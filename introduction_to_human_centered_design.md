## [Introduction to Human Centered Design](https://plusacumen.novoed.com/#!/courses/design-kit-2020-1/home)

- There are three phases of design thinking which are more like overlapping spaces than distinct sequntial steps:-
    - inspiration
    - ideation
    - implementation
- Inspiration phase begins with coming up with a brief which is constraints, a guiding framework and objectives that ensure that the creative realm is not too abstract to leave the project team wandering or too narrow to likely lead to a mediocre outcome.
- Secondly, the team focusses on identifying what people's needs are. Traditonal methods such as focus groups and surveys which in most cases ask people what they want, do not yield much. They are of better use pointing out incremental improvements. Henry Ford: "If I'd asked my customers what they wanted, they'd have said 'a faster horse'". A better starting point is going out to the community and observing the actual experiences of the people through homestays and shadowing their activities.
- The ideation is where the team goes through the process of synthesis, distilling observations into insights. The insights inspire alternative visions of new product offerings, or choices among ways of creating interactive experiences. 
- Linus Pauling: "To have a good idea you must first have lots of ideas"
- Divergent thinking is the route, not the obstacle, to innovation. To achive divergent thinking, it is important to have a diverse group of people involved in the process. For a person to effectively participate in this interdisciplinary environment, they need to have strengths in two dimensions:-
    - depth of skill in order to make tangible contributions, and
    - empathy for the people and for disciplines beyond one's, own expressed as openness to learn through doing, and experimentation
- During the brainstorming stage of the ideation phase, judgement should be deferred. Good ideas generally end up at the top while bad ideas fall off in the process of grouping and sorting the ideas.
- Implementation is where the best ideas are turned into concrete action plan through prototyping. Prototyping helps uncover unforeseen implementation challenges and unintended consequences in order to have more reliable long term success.
